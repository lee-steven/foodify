Foodify will help users organize their groceries/pantry by notifying users when ingredients are getting close to expiration, allowing users to choose ingredients they want to use and find recipes with those ingredients, and more.

## Motivation
As a college student who was transitioning to living off-campus and learning to grocery shop, meal prep, and cook myself, I found that I would often end up not using a lot of the groceries I bought as they would either expire or I would forget about them.
